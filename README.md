# selecta
jquery plugin multiple select list with ordered values as selected

 This is the first time I write jQuery plugin, and I make it quick, so pardon me if my code make you laugh.
 
 I have created this plugin out of my need as I cannot make sense of chosen and select2 multiple select, but the values
 you get is not in order that you are selected. I need it for my project and here it is. This is a very simple plugin 
 and it serve my purpose. 
 
 If you just want a multiple select with search from ajax source, this is not for you. Do I plan to improve it? maybe,
 but I will do when I see fit.
 
 There are 2 functions in this plugin
$.fn.selecta()

$.fn.selectaValues()

Example is in index.html file.
